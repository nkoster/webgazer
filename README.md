This is a UI example which makes use of your camera and AI, to attempt to understand to what part of the screen you're looking at.

The example is taken from this [youtube video from Kyle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6s2Ug-eVpVc). The AI is coming from a project called "[webgazer](https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/)", from brown.edu.

This does not work really well in firefox, at least not for me. However, in Chrome or Chromium, it will blow your mind.

In the example page, you see a randomly fetched image from [picsum.photos](https://picsum.photos). You can "swipe" an image to the left or to right hand side, only by looking to the left or right part of the screen for more than one second.

I have the example working online here: https://aiui.w3b.net/
